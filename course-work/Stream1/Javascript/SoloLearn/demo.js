/* Scripts can also be placed in external files. 
   External scripts are useful and practical when the same code is used in a number of different web pages.
   JavaScript files have the file extension .js.

/* External scripts cannot contain <script> tags.
   You can place an external script reference in <head> or <body>, whichever you prefer.
   The script will behave as if it were located exactly where the <script> tag is located.
   Placing a JavaScript in an external file has the following advantages: 
   - It separates HTML and code.
   - It makes HTML and JavaScript easier to read and maintain.
   - Cached JavaScript files can speed up page loads.
